# Lightspeed

Lightspeed is a small skill-based game, which has been created during the first [SFML Game Jam](http://en.sfml-dev.org/forums/index.php?topic=12497.0).
The goal of the game is to collect as many points as possible by advancing as far as possible.

## Mechanics

The game is completely keyboard based, thus no mouse is required.
To navigate the menu, you use the **Up** and **Down** arrows keys and to select an entry you use **Enter**.

While playing the game you use the **Left** and **Right** key to move the player and you can get an faster movement when holding **Space**.

The text in the upper right corner tells you what the currently active effect is. If there's no text, then current state is Normal.
Next to the different effects there are also variations in speed. The speed can increase or decrease.
The background strips can also have different speeds making things a bit more confusing.

Moving in the danger zone in front of an in-coming box, also known as beam, will grant you a triple point multiplier.
The multiplier will only be active when no effect is active.
